            <em>Dear visitor,</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            This site is protesting against parts of the planned EU copyright reform, which will soon be adopted by the European Parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
            The proposed reform could severely restrict the free Internet. Even the smallest companies would have to use error-prone and technically immature upload filters for all their content (Article 13) and acquire licenses for minimal text excerpts from press products to comply with the so-called ancillary copyright for press publishers (Article 11). This could significantly affect the freedom of opinion, art and the press.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore we ask you for it ...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://saveyourinternet.eu/">... to contact the Members of the European Parliament and to inform them about your position on the planned reform.</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://savetheinternet.info/demos">... to participate in the demonstrations that will take place on March 23rd, 2019 throughout Europe.</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/at-your-service/en/be-heard/elections">... to participate in the election of the European Parliament on 23â€“26 May 2019.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Thank you.
